We planed to use neutron API to create transit network, routes, etc. So it is supposed to be able to support any kinds of distributed router solution, not only OVN. But as discussion below, other developers expected this solution should only use OVN API and  this solution should be specified to OVN. I agreed with their comments. So I'll update the spec to make this spec only for OVN distributed router. Not for other neutron L3 solution.",

The namespace is not OVN, so it is separate from the OVN router (whether the distributed OVN router or the L3 gateway router). You have to go over a port to get to the namespace. Currently, OVN router ports are all patch ports, even if some are centralized while others are distributed. OVN does allow for an OVN router patch port to be directly connected to another OVN router patch port. However, I would think that the OVN port to the namespace looks more like a VIF, from OVN's point of view. OVN does not currently allow a router port to connect directly to a VIF. If you take the easy way out and use OVN router patch port - OVN logical switch patch port - OVN logical switch - OVN logical switch VIF port - namespace, then there is no significant advantage whether you start from the L3 gateway router versus the OVN distributed router.\n\nWhat does make a lot of sense to me is to use the same transit network for VPN agent connectivity as is used for OVN distributed router to OVN L3 gateway connectivity. See https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/Integration_with_OVN_L3_Gateway for details on the latter. Change the default from /30 to something larger. Give the first two ports to the OVN distributed router and the OVN L3 gateway router, then give the third port to the VPN agent. Perhaps more ports will be necessary for VRRP on the L3 gateway router and the VPN agent. On the OVN distributed router, the default gateway points up to the L3 gateway router. Static routes point to the VPN agent.",

However, that just happens to be how the value is derived when VPNaaS runs inside the router, as with the reference implementation.\n\nLook at the description in the API documentation:\n\"Read-only external (public) IPv4 address that is used for the VPN service. The VPN plugin sets this address if an IPv4 interface is available.\"\nThere is nothing in that description about how the VPN plugin derives the address. It is about usage.\n\nThink from an operator's point of view. The user defines a VPN service. The user reads the external_v4_ip, then goes off to the other end of the site-to-site connection and configures that external_v4_ip value as the remote tunnel endpoint. The exact same thing is true for the value that you want to add. Why should the user have to know anything about the underlying implementation in order to know whether to use external_v4_ip or external_ip at the other end of the site-to-site connection?\n\nThe change should be under the covers, not to the VPN table itself.",

My claim is that it is there for VPNaaS, specifically so that someone creating a VPNaaS connection can find out the tunnel IP address to configure on the remote end. Note the API description: \"... that is used for the VPN service.\"\n\nIn case of your OVN VPNaaS implementation, the router gateway address has nothing to do with the VPN service. There is no packet or flow that has the router gateway address anywhere in the packet. There is no need for the user to associate the router gateway address with the VPN service, so external_v4_ip and external_v6_ip should not reflect the router gateway address. The only use of the router gateway address is for your plugin to determine on what subnet to go ask for a port, but that is under the covers and there is no reason for the user to know the details regarding how you got the VPNaaS external IP address. All the user needs to know is the value of the VPNaaS external IP address, not how it was derived. You should decouple the existing external_v4_ip and external_v6_ip from the router gateway address, for the case of OVN.",

The idea is to specify the port, similar to the specification of a port UUID in /v2.0/routers/\u200b{router_id}\u200b/add_router_interface.\n\nIf you do this, I still think the resulting IP address should populate the existing external_v4_ip or external_v6_ip parameter in the existing VPN service table. That way if a customer has a script that grabs that address in order to configure the remote end of a site-to-site IPsec connection, the script will still work.\n\nEven if you do all this, there is still a question whether you should support a user leaving the external_port unspecified, where you automatically create a port for the VPNaaS namespace, in the same subnet as the router external gateway. That would be one way to provide ease of use, while still giving users the option to select the IP address themselves, if they prefer that.",

I did not try to change the definition of the existed VPN  tables.\n/v2.0/routers/\u200b{router_id}\u200b/add_router_interface is used to add the private network gateway port port, not the external gateway port. \nNeutron use the API /v2.0/routers with below request body to add external gateway port:\n{\n   \"router\": {\n      \"external_gateway_info\": {\n         \"network_id\": \"8ca37218-28ff-41cb-9b10-039601ea7e6b\"\n      }\n   }\n}\n\nif we add to existing  /v2.0/vpn/vpnservices api with the port UUID, then customer have to create the port firstly and have to configure it per vpn services. If there are more one vpn service bound with one router, customer need to do  multiple configuration. There are another case is what will happen if customer configures different port for two different vpn services which is bound with a same router?\n\nSo I still think it is better to just to specify the external network UUID, then the plugin will automatically create it with the UUID. That is same as what the router external gateway is doing.\n\nAnd I think it is better to bind the external network with the router id, not the vpn services id. It is also same as vpn use router external gateway IP address.\n\nthat is why I just added some extended attribute with the router. Anyway, if you like, I could change this API URL to /v2.0/vpn/external_port \nbut as I know, the new URL, there will be 5 API for any new URL:POST/PUT/DELETE/GET/LIST. Do we really need so many APIs.\n\nI think after the customer configure the vpn external IP/Port, VPN plugin will schedule a new agent and create the namespace and bind the port/ip to the namespace. This is what the l3-agent was doing.",

Not make that choice based on an unrelated action such as updating the package. Updating the package is only going to require a db sync when upgrading across major versions of OpenStack, so in most cases it's not going to require one. It's just a bad choice imo.\n\nlet's not use that to impose some puppet \"conventions\", which are quite restrictive, unnecessary and unwanted.",
