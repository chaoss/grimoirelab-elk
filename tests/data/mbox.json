Martin Pitt is probably the right person to ask\nabout it, but looking at the language pack sourcepackage should give a\nclue as well.\n\nHowever, I'd note that en_GB is not really the right locale to do\nthe metrics on.\n\n>>>From the 2.3M + 17M MO files in Ubuntu 7.10, a typical GNOME session\n> loads up a subset of the MO files,\n>\n> # lsof | grep \\.mo\\$ | awk '{print $7,$9}' | sort -n | uniq\n>\n> At this moment, my 7.10 is a bit messed up (I have en_GB.UTF-8 but most\n> apps have en_US?!?).

A majority of el_GR probably uses two-byte UTF-8\nsequences, while en_GB would use a majority of single byte UTF-8\nsequences (i.e. ASCII).\n\n> # lsof | grep \\.mo\\$ | awk '{print $7,$9}' | sort -n | uniq | awk\n> '{printf \"%d+\",$1}' > /tmp/bc_sums\n>\n> Using \"bc\" with /tmp/bc_sums gives the figure\n> 3.6M (3624412) for a standard session.

If\nit was untranslated, it would return the passed pointer.\n\nThat can and was used to detect whether there is a translation in some\nprograms (I've seen it done), so, until gains are proven to be big\nenough to warrant breaking a few programs in strange ways, I wouldn't\ndo it on the packaging/build time.\n\nOf course, providing numbers to show what the gains are would help\nmake the decision.\n\nCheers,\nDanilo\n"

            "plain": "Hi, Colin,\n\n10. Sounds good.\n\n13. Our current convention is to bump up the version of ZK value if there\nis any format change. For example, we have bumped up the version of the\nvalue in /brokers/ids/nnn multiple times and all of those changes are\ncompatible (just adding new fields). This has the slight benefit that it\nmakes it clear there is a format change. Rolling upgrades and downgrades\ncan still be supported with the version bump. For example, if you downgrade\nfrom a compatible change, you can leave the new format in ZK and the old\ncode will only pick up fields relevant to the old version. Upgrade will be\ncontrolled by inter broker protocol.\n\nThanks,\n\nJun\n\nOn Wed, Jul 31, 2019 at 1:22 PM Colin McCabe <cmccabe@apache.org> wrote:\n\n> Hi Jun,\n>\n> Thanks for taking another look at this.\n>\n> On Wed, Jul 31, 2019, at 09:22, Jun Rao wrote:\n> > Hi, Stan,\n> >\n> > Thanks for the explanation.\n> >\n> > 10.

            "plain": "Hi, Colin,\n+1 for me\n10. Sounds good.\n\n13. Our current convention is to bump up the version of ZK value if there\nis any format change. For example, we have bumped up the version of the\nvalue in /brokers/ids/nnn multiple times and all of those changes are\ncompatible (just adding new fields). This has the slight benefit that it\nmakes it clear there is a format change. Rolling upgrades and downgrades\ncan still be supported with the version bump. For example, if you downgrade\nfrom a compatible change, you can leave the new format in ZK and the old\ncode will only pick up fields relevant to the old version. Upgrade will be\ncontrolled by inter broker protocol.\n\nThanks,\n\nJun\n\nOn Wed, Jul 31, 2019 at 1:22 PM Colin McCabe <cmccabe@apache.org> wrote:\n\n> Hi Jun,\n>\n> Thanks for taking another look at this.\n>\n> On Wed, Jul 31, 2019, at 09:22, Jun Rao wrote:\n> > Hi, Stan,\n> >\n> > Thanks for the explanation.\n> >\n> > 10.
