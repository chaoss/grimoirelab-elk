## grimoire-elk 1.3.13-rc.1 - (2025-08-28)

**Bug fixes:**

 * [github/raw] huge term in data.auto_merge.commit_message handled\
   This fixes a potential huge term in the "data.auto
   merge.commit_message" field during the `github2:pull` backend's
   collection phase by converting the field to text.
 * Missing creation_date field in Bugzilla\
   For some Bugzilla bugs, the creation date was unavailable. In these
   cases, the first activity date is now used to display the bug's
   creation date.
