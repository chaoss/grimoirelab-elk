## grimoire-elk 0.103.0-rc.3 - (2022-08-23)

**New features:**

 * Configurable study aliases\
   Before this fix, the name of the study aliases was hard coded. From
   now on, these values can be configured by passing them as parameters.
 * Entry points to support enriching plugin mechanism\
   This plugin mechanism allows ELK to use third-party enriching
   backends. Developers only need to include the next snippet in their
   package configuration and ELK will import them as any other core
   backend.  ``` entry_points={"grimoire_elk": "mybackend =
   package.subpackage:get_connectors"}, ``` **NOTE**: In the previous
   example, `get_connectors` is a function that returns the backend
   classes needed to enrich a datasource. Take the next snipped as an
   example: ``` def get_connectors():     return {"backend": [MyBackend,
   MyBackendOcean, MyBackendEnrich, MyBackendCommand]} ```

**Bug fixes:**

 * [raw/slack] Handle fields in "data.file"\
   Avoid the 'Failed to insert data to ES' error when a document contains
   at least one immense term in 'data.file' (whose UTF8 encoding is
   longer than the max length 32766).
