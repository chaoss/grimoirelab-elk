title: GitHub types unified

  The item types for pull requests in the GitHub indices
  had different values. While in `github_pull_requests` the
  type was `pull request`, the type in `github2_pull_request`
  was `pull_request` (with underscore). We have fixed this
  bug unifing the type to `pull_request`. You will have to
  re-enrich indices in your instance to update old items.
