title: Support for Git private repos
category: added
author: Valerio Cosentino <valcos@bitergia.com>
issue: 873
notes: > Git private repos can now be handled by 
ELK, which allows to deal with the credentials that
appear in the repo URLs passed via the projects.json.
These URLs are processed when storing/retrieving the 
data in the raw, enriched and studies indexes to make 
sure that the credentials are not included in the
indexes nor visible on the dashboards.
