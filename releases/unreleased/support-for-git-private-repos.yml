notes: > 
  Git private repos can now be handled by 
  ELK, which allows to deal with the credentials that
  appear in the repo URLs passed via the projects.json.
  These URLs are processed when storing/retrieving the 
  data in the raw, enriched and studies indexes to make 
  sure that the credentials are not included in the
  indexes nor visible on the dashboards.
