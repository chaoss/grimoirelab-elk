title: Incorrect `from-date` behavior for enrich tasks
category: fixed
author: Jose Javier Merchante <jjmerchante@bitergia.com>
issue: null
notes: >
  Enriching no longer uses the `from-date` parameter, which is only
  intended for collection.
  This fixes an issue causing all GitHub items to be enriched.
