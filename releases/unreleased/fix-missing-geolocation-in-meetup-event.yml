title: Fix missing geolocation in Meetup event
category: fixed
author: Valerio Cosentino <valcos@bitergia.com>
issue: 826
notes: >
  This fix allows to process Meetup events for which
  geolocation information isn't provided. For these
  events, the corresponding attribute in the enriched
  index (`venue_geolocation`) is set to None.
