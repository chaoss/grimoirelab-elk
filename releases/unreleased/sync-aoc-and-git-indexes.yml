title: Sync AOC and Git raw indexes
category: added
author: Valerio Cosentino <valcos@bitergia.com>
issue: 884
notes: >
  Git commits can be deleted over time from the original repo (e.g., 
  deleting working/test branches). Currently, this information is 
  propagated to the raw and enriched indexes, but not the AOC 
  index. This new feature allows to sync the Git raw data with 
  the AOC one.
