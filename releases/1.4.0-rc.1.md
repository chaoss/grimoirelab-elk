## grimoire-elk 1.4.0-rc.1 - (2025-09-10)

**New features:**

 * Increased minimum version for Python to 3.10\
   Python 3.9 reaches the end of life in October 2025. This means it
   won't receive new updates or patches to fix security issues.
   GrimoireLab supports Python 3.10 and higher from now on.

**New deprecations:**

 * ElasticSearch 6 no longer supported\
   Elasticsearch 6 is outdated and no longer receives updates. To
   continue development with new features and support for later versions
   of Elasticsearch and OpenSearch, we have had to drop support for ES 6.
