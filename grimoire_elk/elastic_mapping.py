        Different versions of Elasticsearch may need specific versions

        different mappings.

        When the mapping depends on the version of Kibiter/Kibana,
        we will use the Elasticsearch version anyway, since they should
        be paired (same major version for 5 and larger, ES major version 2
        for Kibiter/Kibana major version 4).
